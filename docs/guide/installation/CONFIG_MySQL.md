# MySQL Configuration

This application needs only one MySQL database. But we don't share the database definition to everyone excluding collaborators.

## Default

- host: `localhost`
- dbname: `rho.social`
- username: `root`
- password: ``
- tablePrefix: `rho_`
- charset: `utf8mb4`

We will not change anyone if each of them was not default.
